## 🎯 Benefits of Cleanup

### **1. Focused Repository**

- **Single Responsibility**: Repository now focuses only on authentication services
- **Cleaner Structure**: Easier to navigate and understand
- **Reduced Complexity**: Less files and folders to manage

### **2. Better Separation of Concerns**

- **Infrastructure**: Managed in `mosip-infrastructure` repository
- **Authentication Services**: Managed in this repository
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each repository has specific responsibilities

### **3. Improved Maintainability**

- **Smaller Repository**: Faster cloning and operations
- **Focused Development**: Teams can focus on their specific areas
- **Easier Updates**: Changes are more targeted and manageable

## 🔄 What Happens Next

### **Infrastructure Management**

- **Infrastructure**: Now managed in `mosip-infrastructure` repository
- **Monitoring**: Centralized monitoring in `mosip-infrastructure`
- **Documentation**: Architecture docs in `mosip-infrastructure/docs/`

### **Service Deployment**

- **Authentication Services**: Deploy from this repository
- **Infrastructure**: Deploy from `mosip-infrastructure` repository
- **Monitoring**: Deploy from `mosip-infrastructure` repository

### **Development Workflow**

1. **Infrastructure First**: Deploy infrastructure from `mosip-infrastructure`
